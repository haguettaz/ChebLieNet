    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we present the different functionnalities of our implementation of the group equivariant graph. Such a graph is a k-NN graph representing the structure of a group, a set equipped with a binary operation called the group product. Each vertex of the graph represents an element of the group and the edge's weights corresponds to the Riemannian distance between these element. "

    "\n",
    "The `gechebnet` package implements such a graph and have the basic functions to interact with them. For the most part, it uses PyTorch for tensor operations and PyKeops to achieve a memory and time efficient graph construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph class\n",
    "\n",
    "The main class of the package is the `Graph` class. It stores a graph in a very efficient way using `node_index`, `edge_index` and `edge_weight` attributes. Very easily, we can get important properties of a graph with `num_nodes` or `num_edges`. Other method, properties and attributes are available, we will see them later. However, this class just gives the main structure of a graph, the group equivariant graph inherits from this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important remark is that our graphs are necessarily symmetric, that's why we refer the `knn` parameter as the **maximum** number of neighbours of a vertex."
